// 1. Write a function called helloWorld that returns the string 'Hello World!'.

function helloWorld() {
  return "Hello World!"
}

/*
2. Write a function called lambdaSchool that has a single parameter called num.
     num will be a positive integer.
     If num is divisible by 3 return the string 'Lambda'
     If num is divisible by 5 return the string 'School'
     If num is divisible by 3 AND 5 return the string 'Lambda School' (notice the space)
     If num is NOT divisible by 3 or 5 then return num.

     Example:
             lambdaSchool(15); // returns 'Lambda School'
             lambdaSchool(8); // returns 8
*/

function lambdaSchool(num) {
  var answer = num;

  if (num%15==0){
    answer = "Lambda School";
  } else if (num%5==0){
    answer = "School";
  } else if (num%3==0){
    answer = "Lambda";
  }

  return answer;
}

/*
3. Write a function called longestString that has a single parameter called strs.
     strs will be an array of strings.
     Return the longest string that is in strs.
     If there is a tie for the longest string then return the one that occurs first.

     Example:
             longestString(['hi', 'hello', 'ni hao', 'guten tag']); // returns 'guten tag'
             longestString(['JavaScript', 'HTML', 'CSS']); // returns 'JavaScript'
*/

  var answer = "";

  for (var i = 0; i < strs.length; i++){
    // This could probably be more efficient by creating a variable here that is set to the
    // current string in the array. This way we wouldn't have to index into the array 3 times
    // below, just once here. But JS is a new language for me so I'm not sure about profiling
    // it yet.
    if (strs[i].length>strLength){
      strLength = strs[i].length;
      answer = strs[i];
    }
  }

  return answer;
}

/*
4. Write a function called computeUserAverageAge that has a single parameter called users
     users is an array of user objects.
     Each user object has a property called age that is a number.
     Compute the average age of all user objects in the users array.
     Round off the decimals if needed and return the number.

     Example:
             const users = [{
               name: 'Brendan Eich',
               age: 56,
             }, {
               name: 'Linus Torvalds',
               age: 48,
             }, {
               name: 'Margaret Hamilton',
               age: 81,
             }];
             computeUserAverageAge(users); // returns 62 (This number is rounded up from 61.6666)
*/

  var answer = 0;
  var sum = 0;

  for (var i = 0; i < users.length; i++){
